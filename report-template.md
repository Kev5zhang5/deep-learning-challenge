## Overview of the Analysis
The purpose of this analysis was to develop a binary classification model capable of predicting the success of applicants funded by Alphabet Soup. By leveraging machine learning techniques, specifically a deep learning neural network, the goal was to identify which organizations have the highest likelihood of success when granted funding. This analysis aims to provide the Alphabet Soup foundation with a reliable tool for evaluating funding applicants, ultimately supporting more informed decision-making in their funding initiatives.

## Results
#Data Preprocessing
.The target variable for the model is IS_SUCCESSFUL, indicating whether the organization was successful or not.
.The features used for the model include various attributes of the organizations, such as:
APPLICATION_TYPE           
AFFILIATION                  
CLASSIFICATION              
USE_CASE                     
ORGANIZATION                 
STATUS                       
INCOME_AMT                   
SPECIAL_CONSIDERATIONS       
ASK_AMT.
The following variables were removed from the input data as they are neither targets nor features:
EIN
NAME.
## Compiling, Training, and Evaluating the Model
The neural network model consists of:
Layers: 3 layers (2 hidden layers and 1 output layer)
Neurons:
First hidden layer: 90 neurons
Second hidden layer: 40 neurons
Activation Functions:
Hidden layers: ReLU (Rectified Linear Unit) for its effectiveness in hidden layers.
Output layer: Sigmoid for binary classification.
The model achieved an accuracy of 72.73% on the test dataset.
The model's loss function value was approximately 0.5644, indicating that the model has some room for improvement but is generally performing well in distinguishing between successful and unsuccessful applicants.
## Summary
The deep learning model successfully identified patterns in the dataset to predict the likelihood of success for applicants receiving funding from Alphabet Soup. While the model achieved a satisfactory accuracy of 72.73%, there remains room for improvement.
